An AI-powered Calendar Agent that automatically manages my entire daily schedule using real-time Google Calendar integration. It reads my structured routine, detects conflicts with meetings, intelligently reschedules tasks, and updates my calendar autonomously. The backend uses FastAPI with smart scheduling logic, and the agent can also understand natural-language commands like “schedule my routine for the next 5 days” or “clear this week.” A React dashboard visualizes my tasks, daily plan, scheduling decisions, and the agent’s JSON responses, making it a complete end-to-end personal productivity AI system.
