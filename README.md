An AI-powered Calendar Agent that automatically manages my entire daily schedule using real-time Google Calendar integration. It reads my structured routine, detects conflicts with meetings, intelligently reschedules tasks, and updates my calendar autonomously. The backend uses FastAPI with smart scheduling logic, and the agent can also understand natural-language commands like “schedule my routine for the next 5 days” or “clear this week.” A React dashboard visualizes my tasks, daily plan, scheduling decisions, and the agent’s JSON responses, making it a complete end-to-end personal productivity AI system.

Job Searh Co-Pilot AI is an intelligent career copilot built with Google ADK and Gemini models. It analyzes job descriptions, compares them to my skills and experience, identifies fit and gaps, and even generates tailored resume bullets and recruiter outreach messages. The agent uses tool-calling to parse job descriptions, load my profile, and automatically log job opportunities into a Google Sheets tracker—turning the job search into an automated, AI-driven workflow.
